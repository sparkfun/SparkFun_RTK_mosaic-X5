	</figure>

	!!! tip "Instructional Video"
		:material-youtube: [How to log data to the SD card of the Septentrio mosaic receiver module](https://youtu.be/Y9tvOebnoxk)

??? tip "Button Operation"
	There are multiple ways to configure and enable data logging to an SD card. However, the simplest method is with the ++"LOG"++ button. Once the stream is defined,

	* Pressing the ++"LOG"++ button *(< 5s)* toggles data logging to the SD card on and off.
	* Holding the ++"LOG"++ button for more than 5 seconds *(> 5s)* and then releasing it, will force the board to:
		* Unmount the SD card if it was mounted
		* Mount the SD card if it was unmounted

	For more information, please reference the [SD Card Slot](../hardware_overview/#sd-card-slot) section.


## IO Terminals
Users can easily attach accessories to the RTK mosaic-X5 by wiring them into the terminal blocks on the back of the enclosure.
