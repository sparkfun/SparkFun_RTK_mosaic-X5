Based around the multi-constellation, multi-frequency, L5-ready mosaic-X5 from Septentrio, this is our most advanced RTK product to date. It supports GNSS signals from GPS (USA), GLONASS (Russia), Beidou (China), Galileo (Europe), Navic (India) plus special additional satellites (e.g. SBAS and QZSS). The mosaic-X5 also has built-in on-module support for other L-band correction services.</p> <p>The RTK mosaic-X5 can be configured as a Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) Base, where it feeds corrections to other RTK Rovers, or as an RTK Rover where it can use corrections to achieve a horizontal positioning accuracy of 6 millimeters (0.6cm) (plus 0.5 PPM). For applications like robotics and autonomous systems, the mosaic-X5 can deliver position updates at 100Hz (100 times per second). The mosaic-X5 is a very sophisticated chip running a full internal web page server; the position can be monitored and the module is fully configured through that web page using a standard browser.</p> <p>Under the hood, the RTK mosaic-X5 is powered by the mosaic-X5 GNSS module from Septentrio; and the Espressif ESP32-WROVER processor (16MB flash, 8MB PSRAM). The mosaic-X5 has USB-C connectivity (with Ethernet-over-USB), multiple UARTs and supports full Ethernet connectivity. The only interface it doesn't offer is WiFi and that's why we've included the ESP32 with its own Ethernet connection. You can connect the mosaic-X5 directly to your Ethernet network - our product supports Power-over-Ethernet too. Or you can link the mosaic-X5 Ethernet port to the ESP32 Ethernet port and have the ESP32 provide WiFi connectivity. In that mode, the ESP32 becomes an Ethernet to WiFi Bridge, seamlessly passing WiFi traffic to and from the mosaic-X5 via Ethernet.</p> </li> Product Comparison <p>Below is a simple comparison table between our breakout board and Septentrio's development and evaluation kits:</p> <p>      mosaic-X5 Development Kit      mosaic-go Evaluation Kit      mosaic-X5 GNSS Breakout      RTK mosaic-X5 GNSS Antenna Dual          Single (mosaic-X5)         Dual (mosaic-H)      Single Single USB Connector micro-B micro-B Type-C Type-C Ethernet          Yes 10/100 Base-T No No          Yes 10/100 Base-T WiFi No No No          Yes - Network Bridge 10 Base-T COM Ports 4 2 4          1 - mosaic-X5         1 - ESP32      \u00b5SD Card Slot Yes Yes Yes Yes Reset/Log Buttons Yes No* Yes Yes Logic-Level          1.8V         3.3V      3.3V 3.3V          3.3V         5V      PPS Signal Header Pin 6-Pin JST Connector SMA Connector Screw Terminal Enclosure Material N/A Metal N/A Aluminum Dimensions N/A 71 x 59 x 12mm \u00b1 1mm 70.9 x 50.8 x 8mm          180.6 x 101.8 x 41mm Enclosure Only Weight N/A 58g  \u00b1 1g 22.6g          415.15g Enclosure Only <p>mosaic-go Evaluation Kit</p> <p>The reset pin is exposed on 4-pin JST connector and the log pin is connected to the latch pin of the SD card slot.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/#required-materials","title":"Required Materials","text":"<p>The RTK mosaic-X5 comes with everything you need to get up and running.</p> <p>Kit Contents</p> <p></p> <p>Everything that is included in the RTK mosaic-X5 kit.</p> <ul> <li>Quick Start Guide</li> <li>Cased GNSS Receiver<ul> <li>Aluminum Enclosure (1)</li> <li>10-Way Terminal Blocks</li> <li>Qwiic 1.3\" OLED Display</li> </ul> </li> <li>L1/L2/L5 GNSS Surveying Antenna</li> <li>Reinforced RG58 TNC-SMA Cable (10m)</li> <li>SMA WiFi / Bluetooth Antenna</li> <li>32GB microSD Card (Class 10)</li> <li>USB-C Power Supply (5V 1A wall adapter)</li> <li>USB-C Cable (A to C, 2m)</li> <li>Ethernet Cable (CAT-6, 1m)</li> </ul> <ol> <li>The linked product does not include the front/rear panels and stickers from the RTK mosaic-X5.</li> </ol> <p>Mounting Hardware</p> <p>This kit does not include any mounting hardware for the antenna.

The slotted flanges make it easy to install and secure the enclosure in many locations. But the enclosure only provides limited protection against the ingress of dust and water; it is IP42. So, if you are going to permanently install it up on the roof too, you're going to need a suitable weatherproof box. We found a good one - the Orbit 57095 - also available from Amazon - back when we put together our very first DIY GNSS Reference Station.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <p>How to Build a DIY GNSS Reference Station</p> <p>AC Not Required!</p> <p>The Orbit enclosure comes with a built-in power outlet, but you don't need it! The RTK mosaic-X5 can be powered by Power-over-Ethernet (PoE), meaning all you really need to run up to the roof is a standard 8-core CAT-6 Ethernet cable. Choose a PoE Ethernet Switch that meets your needs.

But you're still going to want to put the GNSS antenna outdoors, so it will have the best view of the sky. Some extra SMA extension cables may be useful and we have good quality low-loss RG58 cables available in the store. The GNSS SMA antenna connection is standard polarity. If you want to extend the ESP32 WiFi / BT antenna connection too, you need a Reverse Polarity (RP) cable for that.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <p>Interface Cable - SMA Female to SMA Male (10m, RG58) CAB-21281</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Use this extension cable for the GNSS antenna.

The slotted flanges make it easy to install and secure the enclosure in many locations. But the enclosure only provides limited protection against the ingress of dust and water; it is IP42. So, if you are going to permanently install it up on the roof too, you're going to need a suitable weatherproof box. We found a good one - the Orbit 57095 - also available from Amazon - back when we put together our very first DIY GNSS Reference Station.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <p>How to Build a DIY GNSS Reference Station</p> <p>AC Not Required!</p> <p>The Orbit enclosure comes with a built-in power outlet, but you don't need it! The RTK mosaic-X5 can be powered by Power-over-Ethernet (PoE), meaning all you really need to run up to the roof is a standard 8-core CAT-6 Ethernet cable. Choose a PoE Ethernet Switch that meets your needs. We have had good experiences with the TP-Link TL-SG1005P - available from many retailers including Amazon.</p>"},{"location":"print_view/#suggested-reading","title":"Suggested Reading","text":"<p>As a more sophisticated product, we will skip over the more fundamental tutorials (i.e. Ohm's Law and What is Electricity?).
